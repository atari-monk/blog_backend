Ah, we've made progress! The `/post/new/` URL is now working (returns 200), but we're getting a new error when trying to submit the form. This is actually good news - it means our URL routing is correct, but we need to handle authentication.

## The New Error

```plaintext
ValueError: Cannot assign "<SimpleLazyObject: <django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object at 0x0000021B71D24050>>": "Post.author" must be a "User" instance.
```

This means:

1. The form is submitting correctly
2. The view is trying to set the author to the current user
3. But no user is logged in (AnonymousUser)

## Solution

We need to:

1. Protect the create view with login requirement
2. Provide a login page for unauthenticated users

### 1. Update your PostCreateView

In `posts/views.py`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

class PostCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Post
    form_class = PostForm
    template_name = 'posts/post_form.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('post_list')
    login_url = reverse_lazy('login')  # Add this line

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.instance.author = self.request.user
        return super().form_valid(form)
```

### 2. Add authentication URLs

In your main `urls.py` (blog_backend/urls.py):

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),  # Add this line
    path('', include('posts.urls')),
]
```

### 3. Create a login template

Create `templates/registration/login.html`:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h2>Login</h2>
<form method="post">
	{% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}
	<button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
<p>Don't have an account? <a href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign up</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

### 4. (Optional) Add signup functionality

If you want user registration:

a. Create a new view in `posts/views.py`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.views.generic import CreateView

class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = 'registration/signup.html'
```

b. Add the URL in `urls.py`:

```python
path('accounts/signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='signup'),
```

c. Create `templates/registration/signup.html`:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h2>Sign up</h2>
<form method="post">
	{% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}
	<button type="submit">Sign up</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

## Testing the Solution

1. Try accessing `/post/new/` - you should be redirected to login page
2. Log in with an admin user (create one first with `python manage.py createsuperuser`)
3. After logging in, you should be able to create posts successfully

## Additional Recommendations

1. Add navigation links in your base template:

```html
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}! <a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Logout</a></p>
{% else %}
<a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login</a> |
<a href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign up</a>
{% endif %}
```

2. Style your forms with CSS for better appearance
3. Add success messages after post creation using Django's messages framework

This solution will:

- Prevent anonymous users from creating posts
- Redirect them to login page
- Automatically set the author to the logged-in user
- Provide a complete authentication flow

## Default redirect issue

It looks like you're encountering a common Django issue where after login, Django tries to redirect to `/accounts/profile/` by default, but you haven't set up this URL in your project.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Set LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL (Recommended)

In your `settings.py`, add:

```python
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'  # Redirect to home page after login
# or
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'post_list'  # Redirect to your post list view
```

### Option 2: Create the profile URL

If you actually want a profile page:

1. Add to your `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('accounts/profile/', views.profile_view, name='profile'),
    # other URLs...
]
```

2. Create a view in `views.py`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def profile_view(request):
    return render(request, 'accounts/profile.html')
```

3. Create a template at `templates/accounts/profile.html`

### Option 3: Override the default behavior

In your login view, you can specify a `next` parameter in the URL or form to redirect elsewhere after login.

## Why This Happens:

Django's default authentication views are configured to redirect to `/accounts/profile/` after login if:

1. No `next` parameter is provided
2. `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` isn't set in settings

## Best Practice:

The most straightforward solution is Option 1 - set `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` in your settings to point to wherever you want users to go after login.

For example:

```python
# settings.py
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'post_list'  # Name of your post list URL pattern
```

This will make the login process work smoothly without requiring you to create a profile page if you don't need one.
